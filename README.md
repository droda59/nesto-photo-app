# Nesto Photo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Runing the application

When starting the application for the first time, you will be prompted to enter username and password. 
For this demo, you do not have to enter any value for either field. You can, though. But it makes no difference: only the user with userId 1 will be requested. 

### Navigating

You can navigate through the user's albums and posts. For each, you have a list of the entries, and a details page. 
The album detail page contains the list of photos in that album, and you can open each photo in fabulous high-resolution! 
The blog post detail page contains comments for that specific blog post. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
